## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Fuelarts accelerator is an 11-week online educational program focused on the development of AI start-ups in the Art + Tech field.

Collaboration with Polkadot is possible in various ways: (1) the company’s name may be included at the accelerator’s course title and/or (2) all the materials can be created and branded in the company’s style.  Moreover, Polkadot can provide up to 50% of mentors to the acceleration program. These mentors may promote the advantages of using Polkadot ecosystem products.

Fuelarts is widely recognized in the web3 and art+tech market, boasting substantial social capital and extensive partnerships. The organization excels at establishing collaborations with prominent market players. Currently, three successful acceleration programs have been conducted, accompanied by the release of five comprehensive reports and guides on investments in the Art + Tech and NFT startups market. Moreover, Fuelarts has organized over 100 webinars, featuring key market players as participants.

Our commitment is to continue driving the market forward alongside major players like Polkadot blockchain. This strategic collaboration aims to empower the blockchain technology sector, bolstering its position in the market. Additionally, our efforts support the development and investment prospects for start-ups, creating a dynamic environment for innovation and growth.

### Project Details

Fuelarts Acceleration program is a 11-week online course for startups. There are couple of criteria for these startups – they should be:

- In Angel / Pre-Seed / Seed stage
- Incorporated
- Have a prototype / MVP

During 11 weeks, Fuelarts conducts in-depth mentoring of the startup, that helps to create a professional advisory board and move the startup from the pre-seed to seed-stage. It is a perfect fit for MVP-stage startups that would like to focus on product-market fit, traction, GTM strategy, and fundraising.

All participants of the acceleration program will take part in the Demo Day, that will be attended by angel investors and VC funds. In addition, all participants of the acceleration program will be invited to discuss potential investments from the Fuelarts fund.

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project enables the blockchain to constantly increase its ecosystem with high-quality new startups, as well as gain wide media coverage by creating its own branded accelerator in partnership with Fuelarts.
Our target audience is Art+Tech, NFT, AI+Art startups.
Thanks to the accelerator startups get the opportunity not only to find and work out the main mistakes in the development of their projects, but also get unique access to Polkadot blockchain specialists, who can then invest in the most promising of them, as well as a huge base of investors and funds.
Our team needs human resources and knowledge of Polkadot employees to train startups, as well as PR partnership will be mutually beneficial for both sides of the project.
At the moment more and more blockchains are developing their own acceleration programs and see great prospects in such an expansion of the ecosystem. A couple of months ago, we held a joint program with the Tezos blockchain, which resulted in 3 out of 10 startups continuing to negotiate and/or started to work with Tezos.
